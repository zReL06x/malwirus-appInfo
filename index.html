            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Malwirus Android app handles your data. Malwirus is designed with privacy-first principles. The app does not collect, store, or sell any personal data on external servers. All analysis happens on your device, and results remain on your device.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>Malwirus does not collect, transmit, or store any of the following on external servers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>SMS message contents or metadata</li>
                <li>Contacts, photos, files, or precise location</li>
                <li>Device identifiers for profiling or advertising</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or behavior tracking</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>How Processing Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>On-Device Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SMS scanning and threat detection are performed locally on your device.</li>
                    <li>Detected results and history are stored only on your device.</li>
                    <li>You can clear history at any time from within the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>Link Safety Checks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you choose to scan a URL, the app sends the URL only to the Google Safe Browsing API to verify potential risks.</li>
                    <li>No additional personal information is attached to these requests.</li>
                    <li>Responses are used solely to inform you about link safety.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>Device Security Signals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security state is evaluated on-device (e.g., root detection, screen capture/record detection).</li>
                    <li>No device security signal is sent to external servers by Malwirus.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Permissions and Purpose</h2>
            <p>Malwirus requests only the permissions needed to provide security features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SMS read/receive: to detect suspicious messages and extract URLs for local analysis.</li>
                <li>Internet and network state: to query Google Safe Browsing for specific URLs you choose to scan.</li>
                <li>Notifications and foreground service: to alert you to potential threats in real-time.</li>
                <li>Screen capture/record detection and device state signals: to warn you of risky conditions on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Permissions can be managed in your device Settings at any time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We use the Google Safe Browsing API solely to check if a URL may be unsafe. Only the URL you scan is sent; no personal identifiers are included. Google may process this data under its own terms and privacy policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="ml-model">
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Malwirus does not retain personal data on external servers. Scan logs and detection history are stored locally on your device and are fully under your control.</p>
            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable/disable URL scanning and other features in Settings.</li>
                <li>Clear local history at any time from within the app.</li>
                <li>Manage app permissions in your device Settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>Malwirus is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
